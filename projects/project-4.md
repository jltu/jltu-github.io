summary: Web application built for our ICS 314 Final Project that showcases the variety of food services and vendors that are offered here at UH Manoa Campus. 
---

## Overview
There are many food choices on campus: campus center, food trucks, Manoa Gardens, Paradise Palms, vending machines, and so forth. With Boujee Foodie, all users can find nearby restaurants at UH Manoa in no time with a list of reviews that will provide users to see what each restaurant has to offer. 

Boujee Foodie is a website that allows individuals, particularly students and faculty, to view the available restaurants on the UH Manoa. In addition, it specifies the restaurant information for each vendor available, allows users to check community reviews as well as add their own reviews, and locates the various restaurants on campus. 

## Contributions
My contribution for this project included creating the landing page which allow users easy access to see what our web application offers. Within the landing page, users can see the top three restaurants along with their reviews. Another component I helped worked on is the list landing page where users can see all the restaurants that are added in our database. I created the edit pages which allow admin accounts to edit the restaurants. In addition to this, I also help create the collections and helped connect everything together on each page. 

## Learning Outcome
In this project, I gained project experience by working as a team of 4 to build this web application.  By practicing issue
driven project management, we were able to work independently while progressing in the project.  Some of the technical skills
that we learned in this project was using JavaScript, Semantic UI, React, and Meteor to build the web application and used
Galaxy for deployment.
