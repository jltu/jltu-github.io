## Study Group Website
## Overview

Problem:
In a university, students come from far and wide across the globe to go to school. As a result of this, there is a high chance that these students will be coming into school not knowing anyone at all. This will make it especially hard for students to form or even find study groups within their classes. 

Solution:
Forming useful and productive study groups have shown to help students learn more effectively. This website would list various students with their own profiles who want to form or join study groups. Depending on the different subjects, and majors of the students, different pages will be shown. 

## Mockup Page Ideas

• Home Landing Page
• Session Info Page
• Session Submission Page
• Add/Edit/Delete Session
• Login/Logout/Sign up
• Profile Edit Page

# Home Landing Page

This page would allow users to search through the listing of different subjects that students want to study for. This page will also show the hottest subjects and/or classes that students are requesting or studying for. 

# Session Information Page

This page would occur after clicking on the selected subject or course that they are interested in.  It would contain more information about the course and will list the people who are currently registered for the study group. 

# Session Submission Page

This would allow user to submit a session with a subject, course, place, time, and description for admins to approve. The page will list the user submissions and will able to edit the submission before admin approval.

# Add/Edit/Delete Session Page

This page allows admin to approve session, edit session and decline submissions sent by users.   

# Log in/Log out/Sign up Page

This page allows users to log in, log out, or sign up for an account.

# Profile/Profile Edit Page

This page allows users to view/edit their profile, allowing them to view/change their username, profile picture, strongest subjects, weakest subjects and preferred meet up times.
