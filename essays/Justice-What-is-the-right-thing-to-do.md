The role of programmers has quickly changed as technology has advanced ever so quickly in our modern society. In a world where the internet has more credibility than ever before, the importance of accurate information and ethical programming is evident. Ethics is a set of rules and standards that people follow as a moral obligation to the way we live. Ethics may not always be related to the law, but rather what is moral and just. Now since technology has more of an impact on society than ever before, it is an ethical concern to have misinofrmed, or inaccurate information in online applications that concern public safety and well-being. 

In the case study involving Facebook, where millions of personal data were collected without the users knowing is evident in violating the the rights to individual privacy in programming code of ethics. Since Facebook is one of the largest social media platforms in the world right now, they have a moral obligation to follow the programming code of ethics. Every software developer and engineer should be obligated and held responsible for the software and programs that they are creating. 

As programmers, we need to make sure that we keep each other accountable for others. We got to make sure to question all instructions and think carefully about what what we are making and how it may impact others. Since technology is ever expanding it may to be difficult to assign a specific set of moral code. Although this is true, as long as we keep each other accountable, we should be prepared for the worst.
